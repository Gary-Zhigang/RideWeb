## Instruction:
This fist step of using our website is registering a user account by typing your username, password and email. Then you can log in our website with that information.
After logging into the website, you will see two options, one is being a passenger and the other one is being a driver. If you choose to be a passenger, then you could 
creat a ride, edit the ride befor it is confirmed and search a ride to join as a sharer. If you choose to be a driver, then you could select a ride to work. There is one
thing that need to note is that the driver can only see the ride which match his/her specical information and vehicle type. After the driver confirm the ride, the status
will become 'comfirmed' and will be 'completed' after the driver clicking the complete button. Besides, each operation will send the passenger/user corresponding email to
show the success of their actions.
